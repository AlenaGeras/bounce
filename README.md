Project Description

The aim of this project is to create a simple 2D arcade game in the Unity environment. The player controls a ball that moves through the game world, collects rings and bonuses, avoids obstacles, and interacts with various objects such as water surfaces or enemy elements. The game includes a level system, life management, and dynamic camera control.
Brief Problem Solution Overview

The game is implemented in C# using the Unity framework. Level loading is done via text files, where individual characters represent specific game objects (e.g., # for obstacles, R for rings, W for water, etc.). The movement and physical interaction of the ball are handled by Unity’s built-in physics engine, while dynamic camera tracking is implemented using the SmoothDamp algorithm. Although other approaches exist—such as optimized collision detection or alternative level parsing methods—the chosen implementation stands out for its simplicity and clarity.
